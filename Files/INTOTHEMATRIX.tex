\chapter{Into The Matrix}

At its core, computational chemistry is basically matrix algebra applied to molecular systems. The performance of an algorithm, in other words its scaling, memory footprint and even accuracy, is intimately linked to how matrix operations and storage are handled internally. While the earliest implementations of molecular electronic structure methods often used hand-coded loops running over matrix indices, over the years, a whole ecosystem of matrix and tensor libraries has emerged in an attempt to lessen the burden of programmers, to various degrees of success, each with their strong and weak points. Choosing the best library for an algorithm is a non-trivial task, and depends on various factors: if memory is the bottle-neck, a sparse matrix library might be able to sufficiently compress data into a smaller space. If speed is the greatest concern, targeting different architectures like distributed memory systems, accelerators, or both, might be the solution.

This chapter introduces basic concepts of matrix and tensor algebra, with a focus on storage orders. After introducing the core concepts, a small list of matrix libraries used in \mchem{} is provided which summarizes the core functionalities.´

\section{Linear Algebra}

Linear algebra is a crucial tool in many areas of computational science, such as image processing, machine learning, computational physics, computational biology and of course computational chemistry. The most important concepts are discussed in this section. Until mentioned otherwise, zero-based indexing is assumed. 

\subsection{Matrices}

A matrix is a rectangular, 2-dimensional array of dimension $M$ by $N$, containing a set of complex or real numbers $\{a_{ij}\}$ with ordered subscripts $i = 0,1,2,...M$ and $j = 0,1,2,...,N$, of the form
\begin{equation}
\mbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{00} & a_{01} & \ldots & a_{0N} \\
a_{10} & a_{11} & \ldots & a_{1N} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{M0} & a_{M1} & \ldots & a_{MN}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\noindent with $M$ \emph{rows} and $N$ \emph{columns}. \emph{Row vectors} and \emph{column vectors} are types of matrices that contain only one row or one column, respectively. 

Matrix multiplication is only defined between matrices of dimension $M$ by $K$ and $K$ by $N$. The product yields an $M$ by $N$ matrix
\begin{align}
\mbf{C}_{M\times N} &= \mbf{A}_{M\times K} \mbf{B}_{K\times N} \\
c_{ij} &= \sum_k a_{ik} b_{kj}
\end{align}

A matrix with an equal number of rows and columns is called a \emph{square matrix}. There a different types of square matrices:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Diagonal matrices} only have non-zero entries on the diagonal
\begin{equation}
a_{ij} = a_{ii} \delta_{ij}
\end{equation}

\item If all entries below the diagonal are zero, the matrix is \emph{lower triangular}. Similarly, if all elements above the diagonal are zero, the matrix is \emph{upper triangular}. Furthermore, if the diagonal entries are all equal to 1, the matrix is \emph{unit triangular}.

\item The \emph{identity} or \emph{unit} matrix $\mbf{1}$ is defined as
\begin{align}
\mbf{A} \mbf{1} &= \mbf{1} \mbf{A} \\
\mbf{1}_{ij} &= \delta_{ij}
\end{align} 

\item The \emph{inverse} of a matrix $\mbf{A}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\mbf{A}^{-1} \mbf{A} = \mbf{1}
\end{equation} 
\noindent It only exists for matrices with a non-zero determinant. If a matrix is non-invertible, it is also called \emph{singular}. 

\item A matrix is \emph{unitary}, if its inverse is equal to its conjugate transpose 
\begin{equation}
\mbf{A}^{-1} = \mbf{A}\pdg
\end{equation}
\noindent A real unitary matrix is called \emph{orthogonal}

\item A \emph{hermitian} matrix is its own conjugate transpose
\begin{align}
\mbf{A} &= \mbf{A}\pdg \\
a_{ij} &= (a_{ji})^*
\end{align}
\noindent A real hermitian matrix is called \emph{symmetric}

\item A hermitian matrix is said to be \emph{positive definite} if all of its eigenvalues are positive, and \emph{negative definite} if all eigenvalues are negative. \emph{Semi-definite} matrices additionally have some eigenvalues which are equal to zero.   
\end{enumerate}

%\subsection{Matrix Decompositions}
%
%Matrix decomposition (or factorization) is one of the fundamental disciplines in linear algebra. Decompositions reduce a matrix into a product of matrices. They can be used to solve a system of linear equations, solve the linear least squares problem, invert a matrix, analyze the numerical stability of a system, or find the \emph{rank} of a matrix, i.e. the number of linearly independent column vectors. Some decomposition techniques can factorize a large and complex matrix into smaller constituents that are more easy to operate on. Examples of matrix decomposition algorithms include
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item The \emph{eigenvalue decomposition} finds a transformation matrix $\mbf{V}$ such that it diagonalizes the matrix
%\begin{equation}
%\mbf{A} = \mbf{V} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mbf{V}^{-1}
%\end{equation}
%\noindent where $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues. This decomposition is only possible for square matrices.
%
%\item The \emph{LU} factorizes a symmetric matrix into a product of a lower triangular matrix $\mbf{L}$ with its transpose
%
%\end{enumerate}

\section{Matrix Storage Formats}

The main memory in a computer, i.e. DRAM, is a linear address space and can be seen as a single, contiguous, one-dimensional array. Two-dimensional arrays like matrices need to be \emph{mapped} to this linear space by the compiler. This mapping depends on whether a dense or sparse view of the matrix is desired. 

\subsection{Dense Storage}

There are two ways to map a dense matrix to memory: row-major ordering and column-major ordering. The two storage orders differ by the order in which the individual elements are stored in memory. For an $M$ by $N$ matrix stored in a linear array $a$ in row-major format, the address offset of an element $a_{ij}$ compared to element $a_{00}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
A(i,j) \rightarrow \text{a[i * N + j]}
\end{equation}
\noindent and in column-major format by
\begin{equation}
A(i,j) \rightarrow \text{a[i + j * M]}
\end{equation}
Neither storage order has any advantages or disadvantages over the other one. It is only a matter of convention, and depends on the library and programming language. Fortran arrays are column-major, while C/C++ arrays are row-major. 

However, algorithms optimized for column-major access might not give the same performance for row-major formats and vice-versa. Consider a simple loop over matrix elements in the Fortran programming language
\begin{fortran}{Matrix Loop \label{FORTRAN1}}
DO i = 1, N
 DO j = 1, N
  A(i,j) = A(i,j) + 2
 ENDDO
ENDDO
\end{fortran}
\noindent By first looping over the rows, and then over the columns, the elements in the column-major matrix are accessed in a \emph{non-contiguous} manner. This prevents efficient optimizations like vectorization due to cache misses. By swapping the loops, the inner loop can be vectorized. Therefore, if algorithms assume a certain ordering, it is important to pass matrices of the same ordering.

Column-major ordering is by far the most common in scientific computing. Matrix algebra routines like the QR, Eigenvalue or Cholesky decompositions are most intuitively written using column operations rather than row operations. Examples include the LAPACK and Eigen matrix libraries. 

\subsection{Sparse Storage}

A matrix is called \emph{sparse} if "most" of its elements are zero. The threshold between sparse and dense is ill-defined, and range anywhere between 1\% and 10\%. Sparse matrices are encountered in many fields of computational science in systems with few pair-wise interactions. By storing and looping over the significant elements only, the memory footprint and the scaling of matrix multiplications or decompositions can be significantly reduced. There are several different sparse matrix formats available. The following sections will demonstrate how the matrix
\begin{equation*}
\begin{pmatrix}
3 & 5 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 6 & 7 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\noindent may be represented using some of these formats.

\subsubsection{Coordinate Format}

The coordinate format (COO) is one of the simplest storage schemes for sparse matrices. The matrix is stored using three arrays of length $NNZ$ (number of non-zero elements) containing the row indices, column indices and matrix entries. The above matrix reduces to 
\begin{equation*}
COO: \left\lbrace
\begin{matrix}
\textrm{idx\_i} &= &\left[ 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3 \right] \\
\textrm{idx\_j} &= &\left[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 \right] \\
\textrm{val}   &= &\left[ 3, 5, 4, 1, 6, 2, 7 \right] \\
\end{matrix}
\right.
\end{equation*}
\noindent The values do not need to be necessarily ordered. The COO format has the advantage that it is very easy to insert elements and change the sparsity pattern with low overhead. COO is generally not used for algebra due to slow random access of elements if they are not stored in order. Rather, COO is an intermediate format for incremental construction of sparse matrices in the CSR or CSC format.

\subsubsection{Compressed Sparse Row}

The compressed sparse row format (CSR) is similar to COO, but compresses the rows. A CSR matrix is represented by three arrays: the extent of rows, the column indices and non-zero matrix entries, with dimension $M$, $NNZ$ and $NNZ$ respectively. For the example matrix above, the CSR format gives
\begin{equation*}
CSR: \left\lbrace
\begin{array}{lll}
\textrm{row\_ext} &= &\left[ 0, 2, 3, 5 \right] \\
\textrm{col\_idx} &= &\left[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 \right] \\
\textrm{val}  &= &\left[ 3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 6, 7 \right] \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}
\noindent The $i$th entry of the row extents contains the offset to the first non-zero element in the array \textrm{val} in the $i$th row. The entries in \textrm{col\_idx} are the associated column indices. Compared to COO, accessing elements is much faster, and the memory prefactor is reduced from $3NNZ$ to $2NNZE+M$. Matrix-vector products are very fast to compute, but CSR in not well suited for column slicing.

\subsubsection{Compressed Sparse Column}

The compressed sparse column format (CSC) is the "column-major" analog to the CSR format. Instead of compressing the rows, it compresses the columns. The matrix in the CSC format is represented as

\begin{equation*}
CSC: \left\lbrace
\begin{array}{lll}
\textrm{col\_ext} &= &\left[ 0, 1, 3, 5 \right] \\
\textrm{row\_idx} &= &\left[ 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 \right] \\
\textrm{val}  &= &\left[ 3, 5, 4, 1, 6, 2, 7 \right] \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}

CSC has similar performance to CSR, but is better suited for column slicing and therefore column-oriented matrix decomposition.

\subsection{Block Compressed Sparse Row}

The block-compressed sparse row (BCSR or BSR) format is a generalization of CSR. BCSR is ideal for matrices which are \emph{block-sparse}, i.e. matrices with few dense submatrices. For a constant block size $n$ by $m$, let the number of row and column blocks be $M_{blk}$ and $N_{blk}$, and $NNZ_{blk}$ the number of significant blocks. A matrix is then represented by three arrays containing the row block offsets, column block indices, and non-zero indices with size $M_{blk}$, $NNZ_{blk}$ and $NNZ_{blk}mn$. For blocks of size 2 by 2, the matrix above in the BCSR format yields

\begin{equation*}
BCSR: \left\lbrace
\begin{array}{lll}
\textrm{rowblk\_ext} &= &\left[ 0, 1 \right] \\
\textrm{colblk\_idx} &= &\left[ 0, 1 \right] \\
\textrm{val}  &= &\left[ 3, 0, 5, 4, 1, 6, 2, 7 \right] \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}

\noindent The matrix is therefore split into two non-zero blocks of size 2-by-2 each, with elements $\{3,0,5,4\}$ and $\{1,6,2,7\}$ using column-major ordering. The BCSR format can further reduce the storage prefactor for block-sparse matrices compared to CSR or CSC. Smaller block-sizes can account for a higher degree of sparsity, but lead to a higher prefactor. Large block sizes have lower prefactor, but capture less of the sparsity. Figure \ref{fig:DISTSTOR2} shows the BCSR format for different split factors. The block sizes do not need to be the same, although a constant block size is best suited for load balancing. Whether a block is significant or not depends on the matrix norm that is chosen as a criterion for filtering. Popular choices include the Frobenius norm or the max norm. 

\subsection{Distributed Storage}

In distributed memory parallelism, processes do no longer have access to the whole matrix. The question then arises how to distribute data over multiple nodes or processes. Distribution can be \emph{blocked} or \emph{cyclic} (Figure \ref{fig:DISTSTOR1}). In the block representation, the matrix is distributed by dividing rows, columns (or both) by the number of processes, and distributing them sequentially over the processes. On the other hand, the cyclic representation distributes each individual row, column or matrix element over the set of processes and wrapping over them until all elements are assigned to a processor. The cyclic data layout achieves great load balancing by evenly distributing the matrix elements, but is not suitable for row or column manipulations due to a high communication overhead. A blocked representation can reduce this overhead, but load-balancing is more difficult to achieve if the number of elements is not evenly divisible by the number of processes. 

The most commonly used format for distributed matrix storage is the \emph{block-cyclic} representation (Figure \ref{fig:DISTSTOR2}). It combines the best of both worlds, with good load-balancing and low communication overhead for matrix algebra. Communication is most efficient by arranging processes into a 2-dimensional rectangular grid with $N_{proc} = N_{row} \times N_{col}$, such that each process is uniquely identified by its coordinates $(i,j)$. A 4-by-2 grid therefore has 4 \emph{process rows} and 2 \emph{process columns}. With MPI, this is most easily achieved by using \emph{Cartesian grids}. In Cartesian grids, processes can only communicate with their nearest neighbor. 

Each process has a local array which can be packed in different ways. The ScaLAPACK library keeps the original ordering of the matrix elements, while other matrix libraries like DBCSR store the individual blocks sequentially in memory. Blocks do not necessarily need to be equal in size. Libraries like DBCSR also support heterogeneous block sizes.

All the sparse storage schemes discussed in the previous sections can also be applied to distributed matrices. DBCSR uses a block-sparse row format which distributes the significant blocks over the processors in a row-major format (Figure \ref{fig:DISTSTOR3}). 

\begin{figure}

%The block size has a major impact on the performance of distributed linear algebra algorithms. Consider the multiplication of two matrices. Multiplication can be reformulated in terms of individual multiplications of sub-blocks. 

\section{Tensors}

\subsection{Definitions}

Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays and can be seen as a generalization of matrix objects to higher dimensions, containing a set of complex or real values $\{a_{ijk...}\}$ with the ordered indices $i = 0,1,2,...N_0$, $j = 0,1,2,...N_1$, $k = 0,1,2,...N_2$ etc. The total number of indices required to identify an element in a tensor corresponds to its \emph{dimension}, also called \emph{rank}, \emph{order} or \emph{degree}. It should be stressed that tensor rank is different from the concept of a matrix rank. 

Tensors are important quantities in various scientific fields, especially in physics and quantum chemistry. Examples of tensor are the 4-dimensional MP2-amplitudes $t_{iajb}$ or the 3-dimensional 3c2e electron integrals. Matrices can be seen as 2-dimensional tensors. 

The analog of matrix multiplication is \emph{tensor contraction}, which involves the summation over one or multiple indices. Consider for example the tensor contraction
\begin{equation}
C_{ijm} = \sum_{kl} A_{ikjl} B_{lkm}
\end{equation}
\noindent Here, the summation runs over the indices $kl$. Alternatively, the expression above can be abbreviated as
\begin{equation}
C_{ijm} = A_{ikjl} B_{lkm}
\label{eq:TENEX}
\end{equation}
\noindent which is known as  \emph{Einstein summation}, a notational convention used to simplify tensor expressions. Indices appearing on the right but not on the left are implicitly summed over. 

\subsection{Tensor Storage and Mapping \label{sec:tenstor}}

Mapping multi-dimensional to the linear main memory is non-trivial. Tensors may follow a generalized column or row major storage such that
\begin{align}
A(i_0,i_1,...,i_n) &\rightarrow \sum_{k=0} \left( \prod_{l=k+1}^{N_{dim}} n_l \right) i_k \qquad \textrm{row-major} \\
A(i_0,i_1,...,i_n) &\rightarrow \sum_{k=0} \left( \prod_{l=0}^{k-1} n_l \right) i_k \qquad \textrm{column-major} 
\end{align} 
\noindent where $N_{dim}$ is the dimension of the tensor, and $n_k$ is the size of dimension $k$.

Consider again the tensor contraction \ref{eq:TENEX}. It can be programmed by just looping over all elements explicitly:
\begin{fortran}{Tensor Loop \label{lst:TLOOP}}
DO i = 1, ndim_i
  DO j = 1, ndim_j
    DO m = 1, ndim_m
      DO k = 1, ndim_k
        DO l = 1, ndim_l
          C(i,j,m) = A(i,k,j,l) * B(l,k,m)
        ENDDO
      ENDDO
    ENDDO
  ENDDO
ENDDO
\end{fortran}
\noindent Similarly to Example \ref{FORTRAN1} which loops over matrix elements, efficient parallelization by means of vectorization is a major concern when coding tensor contractions by hand. Ideally, tensor contractions should be offloaded to a specialized library. However, writing a general tensor library is a complex task, as the optimal kernel is dependent on the nature of the tensor contraction, i.e. number of indices involved, tensor dimensions and memory mapping. Whereas the \textrm{dgemm} BLAS routine only needs to know whether the matrices are transposed or not, the rapidly increasing number of parameters and loops makes it very difficult to write optimized code for arbitrary tensor contractions. For the example above, there are already $5!$ = $120$ different ways to arrange the loops.  

Many tensor libraries solve this problem by mapping tensors to matrices so that existing code for optimized matrix-matrix multiplication can be used instead. Consider the tensor $A_{ikjl}$. By introducing the \emph{super-indices} $P$ and $Q$, the tensor can be mapped to a matrix with $N_P$ = $n_i n_k$ rows and $N_Q$ = $n_j n_l$ columns with
\begin{align}
P(i,k) &= i + k*n_i \\
Q(j,l) &= j + l*n_j
\end{align}
\noindent The individual tensor elements are then accessed by
\begin{equation}
A(i,k,j,l) \rightarrow P(i,k) + Q(j,l) N_P
\end{equation}
\noindent using column-major storage for both the indices and super-indices. This corresponds to mapping $ik$ to the rows and $jl$ to the columns of a large matrix, which may also be written in a condensed notation as $\cn{01}{23}$, where $0,1,...$ indicate the mapping of the first, second, ... index of the tensor. As another example, consider the mapping $\cn{0}{213}$: this indicates that the index $i$ is mapped to rows, and $jkl$ are mapped to the columns. Alternatively, the mapping can be indicated by using upper or lower indices. $\cn{01}{23}$ corresponds to $A_{ik}^{jl}$ and $\cn{0}{213}$ to $A_{i}^{jkl}$. The lower indices are also known as \emph{covariant} indices, and the upper indices as \emph{contravariant} indices. From here on out, only the notation $\cn{\cdot}{\cdot}$ will be used.

Coming back to the tensor contraction in \ref{eq:TENEX}, mapping the tensors according to $A_{ikjl}^{\cn{02}{13}}$, $B_{lkm}^{\cn{10}{2}}$ and $C_{ijm}^{\cn{01}{2}}$, the contraction can be reformulated as a simple matrix multiplication
\begin{equation}
\mbf{C} = \mbf{A} \mbf{B}
\end{equation}
\noindent and optimized matrix libraries can be used to perform the tensor contraction. It is also possible to choose the mapping $B_{lkm}^{\cn{2}{10}}$, and the tensor contraction may be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\mbf{C} = \mbf{A} \mbf{B}^T
\end{equation}
\noindent by taking the transpose of $\mbf{B}$. In general, any tensor contraction can be reformulated as a matrix multiplication by mapping the indices which are summed over to either the row or column of a matrix, and the indices which are not involved to the remaining dimension. 

There are two drawbacks to this approach: first, tensors which are participating in different types of tensor contractions may need to be reordered. Reordering can take up a significant amount of time and add overhead to the tensor contraction, and it effectively doubles the amount of space needed by the tensor. Second, standard matrix libraries may not be optimized to handle tall-and-skinny (TAS) matrices. TAS matrices are matrices where one dimension is much larger then the other one, which is often the case for tensors with uneven mappings. Consider the tensor  $B_{lkm}^{\cn{10}{2}}$. It maps to a matrix with $n_kn_l$ rows and $n_m$ columns. If this matrix is distributed over an MPI grid, the process columns have much more work to perform than the process rows, which may lead to load imbalances. This problem can be addressed by dividing the TAS matrices into multiple square submatrices to improve load balancing, but at the cost of adding further complexity to the code.

\section{Matrix Libraries}

This section briefly describes the different matrix libraries that are used in \mchem{}.

\subsection{BLAS}

Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) is a \emph{specification} that describes a set of fundamental operations on vectors and matrices which serve as building blocks for higher level algebraic functionality \cite{BLAS2021}. The subroutines are grouped into different \emph{levels}. BLAS 1 provides vector-vector operations, BLAS 2 performs matrix-vector operations, and BLAS 3 provides matrix-matrix operations. Implementations of the BLAS library are often optimized for a certain type of processor, such as Intel's math kernel library (MKL) or the BLAS-like instantiation software (BLIS) which are optimized for Intel and AMD processors respectively. By providing a general interface, BLAS-based code is highly portable and should be preferred over processor-dependent, intrinsic functions. 

\subsection{LAPACK}

The linear algebra package (LAPACK) provides routines for matrix factorizations such as the QR decomposition, eigenvalue decomposition or singular value decomposition \cite{LAP2021}. It also includes functions for solving systems of linear equations and linear least squares problems. The official Netlib LAPACK implementation is based on BLAS and therefore highly portable, and simply linking the corresponding BLAS library that is optimized for the targeted architecture is sufficient. However, processor-specific re-implementations of LAPACK such as Intel MKL also exist. LAPACK can handle dense matrices only. 

\subsection{Eigen}

Eigen is a C++ template library that provides basic and advanced matrix algebra routines, including numerical solvers and matrix decompositions \cite{Gue2010}. Compared to LAPACK, Eigen offers a more user-friendly interface with an API that is closer in form to to standard algebraic notation. A matrix multiplication with addition is as simple as writing
\begin{cpp}{Eigen Matrix Multiplication}
Eigen::MatrixXd A, B, C;
// initialize matrices
A = A + B * C;
\end{cpp}
\noindent Matrix manipulations, such as row, column or block operations are also much more intuitive, which is its primary use in \mchem{}.

\subsection{PBLAS}

PBLAS (Parallel BLAS) is a generalization of the BLAS specification to distributed memory environments \cite{PBLAS2021}. It uses BLACS (basic linear algebra communication subprograms) as the message passing interface, typically built on MPI, and optimized for 2D grid communication. Matrices and vectors use a block-cyclic distribution with homogeneous block sizes across processor rows and columns. Similarly to BLAS, it provides a general interface and several different implementations exist (Netlib, Intel MKL, IBM, Cray). It closely mimics the function signature of BLAS, but matrices have an additional \emph{array descriptor} which holds all parameters of the matrix distribution. Matrix multiplication is performed using Cannon's algorithm \cite{Can1969}.

\subsection{ScaLAPACK}

Scalable LAPACK (ScaLAPACK) is LAPACK's analog for distributed memory systems \cite{Sca2021}. It provides highly optimized, advanced linear algebra routines based on the PBLAS interface.  It solves linear least squares, eigenvalue and singular value decomposition problems, among others. Again, while the specification is general, processor optimized implementations are often encountered, which are even more crucial in the context of high-performance computing. 

Compared to LAPACK, ScaLAPACK does not support many matrix decompositions with pivoting. Pivoting incurs a very high overhead due to the increased communication between nodes.

\subsection{DBCSR}

DBCSR (distributed block compressed sparse row) is a Fortran library designed for efficient sparse matrix multiplication in distributed memory environments \cite{Bor2014,DBCSR2020}. It is OpenMP and MPI parallel and can exploit NVIDIA and AMD GPUs via Cuda and HIP. It uses a sparse block-cyclic matrix storage format (Figure \ref{fig:DISTSTOR2}) and was originally developed for linear-scaling self-consistent field calculations within CP2K, a quantum chemistry and solid state physics software package \cite{Hut2014,Sch2016}. 

The DBCSR matrix multiplication architecture is divided into several layers managing data transfer, data access and offloading. Figure \ref{fig:ARCH} shows a schematic representation of the layers. The top-most layer manages the parallelization of the matrix multiplication over multiple nodes, and subdivides the matrix into large sparse sub-matrices, or \emph{panels}, which contain approximately the same number of blocks. A block-generalized version of Cannon's algorithm \cite{Can1969} is used to communicate the panels to different processes in a regular and ordered fashion. At each "tick" of Canon's algorithm, each process  sends and receives panels which it then multiplies and adds to the local blocks. 

The multiplication of the panels is handled by the multrec layer, which subdivides panels \emph{recursively} along the longest dimension until the submatrices are small enough to fit into cache size.

The CSR layer then determines which blocks need to be multiplied from the sparsity pattern of the matrices. It generates a list of needed block-multiplications, called \emph{stacks} and passes this information to the scheduler. The scheduler receives the stacks and arranges them for processing by handing them off to different drivers. Stacks can be processed either by the host (CPU) or the device (GPU). Both drivers support standard matrix multiplication by using (cu/hip)-BLAS, as well as small matrix multiplication (SMM) which are handled by specialized SMM libraries optimized for CPU (libxsmm) or GPU (libsmm\_acc). 

For a multiplication of matrices with dimension $N$ by $K$ and $K$ by $M$, a problem size suitable for SMM libraries approximately falls within $(MNK)^{1/3} < 64$. Block-sparse matrices in quantum chemistry often have very small block sizes. However, standard libraries like BLAS are most often optimized for very large matrices, and SMM libraries are often crucial to reduce the overhead when using small block sizes. 

In 2019, the DBCSR library  was extended to handle tensor contractions using the TAS matrix mapping discussed above \cite{Siv2019}. It is an \emph{ad-hoc} extension of the DBCSR matrix machinery, and still somewhat experimental. Memory issues are commonly encountered (see chapter 7).

A C-interface to the DBCSR library was written as part of this PhD project \cite{Amb2020}.
